## 📝 Abstract

The recent advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has significantly improved their fine-grained perception of single images and general comprehension across multiple images. However, existing MLLMs still face challenges in achieving precise grounding in complex multi-image scenarios. To address this, we first explore a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) framework that integrates single-image grounding with multi-image comprehension. While partially effective, it remains unstable and struggles to capture abstract visual information due to its non-end-to-end nature. Therefore, we introduce 🎩<strong>Migician</strong>, the first multi-image grounding model capable of performing free-form and accurate grounding across multiple images. To support this, we present the [MGrounding-630k](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Michael4933/MGrounding-630k) dataset, which comprises data for several multi-image grounding tasks derived from existing datasets, along with newly generated free-form grounding instruction-following data. Furthermore, we propose [MIG-Bench](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Michael4933/MIG-Bench), a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for evaluating multi-image grounding capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves significantly superior multi-image grounding capabilities, outperforming the best existing MLLMs by 21.61% and even surpassing much larger 70B models.

Migician surpasses much larger 70B scale model over all tasks on MIG-Bench by a great margin as shown in the radar image above. Additionally, it demonstrates great competitiveness in several general multi-image understanding benchmarks. We are looking forward to the promising applications of Migician on a broad spectrum of real-world scenarios.

<span id='Data Preparation'/>

### 2. Data Preparation <a href='#all_catelogue'>[Back to Top]</a>
MGrounding-630k encompasses a diverse collection of multi-image grounding tasks and numerous images from different sources. For convenient utilization, we have uploaded the entire training dataset on [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Michael4933/MGrounding-630k) and organized these massive data collections according to their task class. 
> [!NOTE]
> Due to the nature of multi-image tasks, each training example involves multiple images. As a result, the 600k+ training examples collectively include an even larger number of images.
>
> Please ensure that you have sufficient hard disk storage and a stable internet connection.

You can download the data at `./data/MGrounding-630k` and then simply unzip the corresponding .zip files. This brings you the data structure shown below. We gather all the conversation data at `./data/MGrounding-630k/MGrounding-630k.json` for convenient use, where each training example is labeled with its corresponding sub-task class. The seperate json files for each task is also provided along the way. We just want the best for ya~~~🥰

The downloading code from huggingface is provided in `./data/download.py`, which realizes one-hit quick download.

The final code structure is show as follows:
